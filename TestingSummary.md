# Testing Summary
In this game, we conducted two automated integration tests and unit tests for the Model.
- unit test

We've written some unit test cases to test whether the `Evaluation` class can figure out the best next step in the current situation and correctly handle the state of each position on the board.
- Automatic UI testing

We did two automatic UI tests, one was to detect if the board is emptied after clicking “New Game” in the game interface, and when the bomb was placed, the nearby pieces disappeared.
